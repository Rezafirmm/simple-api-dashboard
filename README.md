\# 👥 User Manager API Project



In this project, a simple user management page is built using the `JSONPlaceholder` service to demonstrate how to send and receive data with different HTTP methods.

💡 About the Project : 



This project was created to learn and practice working with APIs, understand HTTP methods, and gain hands-on experience with the Fetch API.

Although the data is not permanently stored on the server, all requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are actually sent to simulate real API interactions.
